## Introduction

Brawl Stars is a multiplayer online battle arena game developed and published by Supercell. It features various game modes, characters, and maps, providing an engaging experience for players worldwide. In this project, we analyze data collected from Brawl Stars to uncover interesting patterns and trends.

## Data Collection

To collect the data for this project, we utilized various methods. We scraped player statistics and game data from official Brawl Stars APIs, such as the Brawl Stars API. These APIs provide access to a wide range of data, including player profiles, match history, and leaderboard rankings.

## Data Analysis

We utilize Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and geopandas to perform data analysis on the Brawl Stars dataset. The dataset includes information about player statistics, average trophies, total trophies, and more. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into player performance, regional differences, and overall game dynamics.[Click here](https://clausa.app.carto.com/map/d749befd-e66b-4ad0-bff7-5b26dd17dde6) to see the interactive map and dashboard generated for the analysis.

## Visualizations

To better understand the data, we create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. These visualizations include histograms, correlation heatmaps, and regression plots. By visualizing the data, we can identify patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the Brawl Stars African landscape. By analyzing player statistics, trophy distribution, and regional trends, we can gain a deeper understanding of the game's dynamics. These insights can be useful for players, game developers, and researchers interested in the mobile gaming industry.
